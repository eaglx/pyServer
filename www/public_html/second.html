		"Upon this, one has to remark that men ought either to be well treated or
		crushed, because they can avenge themselves of lighter injuries, of more
		serious ones they cannot; therefore the injury that is to be done to a man
		ought to be of such a kind that one does not stand in fear of revenge."
									Niccol√≤ Machiavelli
